  <h1>Privacy Policy for FitZap</h1>
  <p>Effective date: September 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you create an account, we collect your name and email address. 
     You may also choose to log fitness-related data such as workouts, meals, and body weight. 
     We do not store your password in plain text â€” it is securely encrypted so even we cannot view it.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used only to provide login access, save your fitness progress, 
     and personalize your app experience.</p>

  <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
  <p>FitZap uses Google AdMob to display limited ads. AdMob may collect anonymous usage data to provide relevant ads. 
     No personally identifiable information is shared with advertisers.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use encryption and secure methods to protect your data. 
     While we take reasonable measures, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. 
     Third-party services (like AdMob) may collect non-personal data for analytics and ads.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request deletion of your account or data anytime by contacting us at the email below.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
